# Smart Medicine Box 💊📦

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Smart Medicine Box** is an IoT-based healthcare project designed to help users take medicines on time and reduce missed doses. The system provides **timely reminders**, **automatic medicine dispensing**, and **alerts** using sensors and a microcontroller.

This project is especially useful for **elderly patients**, **chronic disease patients**, and individuals who require strict medication schedules.


## 🎯 Objectives
- To remind users to take medicines at scheduled times  
- To automate medicine dispensing using a motor mechanism  
- To reduce human error in medication intake  
- To improve medication adherence using alerts and notifications  


## 🛠️ Hardware Components Used
- ESP32 Microcontroller  
- DC Motor (for medicine dispensing)  
- Motor Driver Module (L298N)  
- IR Sensors (for angle detection and hand detection)  
- Buzzer (audio alerts)  
- LEDs (status indication)  
- LCD Display (medicine and alert display)  
- Power Supply  


## 💻 Software & Tools
- Arduino IDE  
- Embedded C / C++  
- Custom Mobile / Web UI (replaced Blynk)  


## ⚙️ Working Principle
1. Medicine timings are set using a custom user interface.
2. At the scheduled time, the ESP32 triggers alerts using a buzzer and LEDs.
3. The DC motor rotates by a fixed angle to dispense medicine.
4. An IR sensor ensures accurate rotation and position detection.
5. A hand-detection IR sensor confirms medicine collection.
6. If medicine is not taken, a **missed dose alert** is generated.



## 🔁 System Flow
- Schedule → Alert → Dispense → Detect Hand → Confirm Intake  
- If not detected → Missed Dose Alert
